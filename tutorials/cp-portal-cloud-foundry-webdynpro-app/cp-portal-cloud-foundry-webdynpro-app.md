### View the app that you created


Use the breadcrumbs at the top to go back to the **Content Manager**.

 ![Go back to Content Manager](8-go-to-content-manager.png)

You can see your Web Dynpro ABAP app in the list:

  ![View app](8a-view-app.png)

In the next steps, we'll make the app visible for users. To do this, we need to assign the app to a role (the same role that the user is assigned to). Depending on which view mode has been set in the **Site Settings** screen, we also need to add the app to a page if you're working in **Spaces and Pages - New Experience** mode. If you're working in **Groups** mode or in **Spaces and Pages** mode, then you'll assign your app to a group. 
Here's a view of the **Site Settings** screen with the different view modes.  In this tutorial we'll be working in the **Spaces and Pages - New Experience** mode.

![View modes](28-view-modes.png)


If you're not sure what view mode is selected, go to the **Site Settings** screen as follows: 

 1. Open the Site Directory from the left panel and on the site tile, click the cog icon.
    
    ![Open Site Settings](27-open-settings.png) 
    
 2. On the right side of the screen, under **View Mode**, you can see which mode you're working in. To change it, click **Edit** and then **Save** your changes.

 3. Once you're done, go back to the Content Manager using the breadcrumbs at the top of the screen.

    ![Site Settings](26-site-settings-screen.png)


### Assign the app to the Everyone role


> To view the app in runtime, you must assign the app to a role. Content assigned to the `Everyone` role is visible to all users.

1. In the **Content Manager**, click the `Everyone` role.

    <!-- border -->![Click everyone role](11-click-everyone-role.png)

2. Click **Edit**.

    ![Click Edit](11a-click-edit.png)

3. Under the **Apps** tab, you'll see that your `Search POs` app has an **X** in the **Assignment Status** column. Click the toggle to assign the app to the `Everyone` role and click **Save**.

    ![Assign app to role](12-assign-role.png)

>If you have many apps, you can type some letters of your app name in the search bar, (for example, `se`) to search for the app.

### Add the App to Your Page

>**This step is only if you're working with Spaces and Pages.** 

In a previous tutorial, you've already created a Space called `Home` and a Page called `Overview`. Now let's add the Web Dynpro app to the page.

1. Open the Content Manager. 

    ![Open content manager](17-open-content-manager.png)

2. Select the `Overview` page. 

    ![Select page](18-select-page.png)

    You'll see the apps that you've already added.

3. Click **Edit**. 

    ![Click edit](19-click-edit.png)

4. Hover in the section containing the other apps, and click the **+** icon on the right.

    ![Click add icon](20-open-tiles.png)

5. Select the `Search POs` app that you've just configured and click **Add**.

    ![Add the app](22-add-app.png)

6. Click **Save**. Your Web Dynpro is added to the `Overview` page to the same section as your other apps.  

    ![View page](23-final-view.png)


### Assign the app to a group 

> **This step is only for those working in **Groups** view mode (defined in the **Site Settings** screen). If you're working with the new site experience and selected **Spaces and Pages - New Experience** mode, please skip this step**.

A group is a set of one or more apps displayed together in your site. Assigning apps to groups, makes them visible to users of the site.
 
 1. Go back to the **Content Manager** using the breadcrumbs at the top of the screen.

    ![Go back to content manager](12a-go-to-content-manager.png)

2. Click **Create** and select **Group** from the list to create a group.

    <!-- border -->![Add new Group](9-add-group.png)

3. Name the group `Purchase Orders`.

4. Under the **Apps** tab, you'll see that your `Search POs` app has an **X** in the **Assignment Status** column. Click the toggle to assign the app to the `Purchase Orders` group and click **Save**.  If you're taking part in a workshop, please use your unique app: `<unique_id>_Search POs`

    ![Assign app to group](10-assign-to-group.png)


### Launch the app


1. From the side panel, click the Site Directory icon to open the **Site Directory**.

    ![Open site directory](13-open-site-directory.png)

2. On the `JobCore` tile , click the **Go to site** icon.

    ![Go to site](14-go-to-site.png)

3.  If you're working in spaces and pages mode, you'll see that the `Search POs` app is added to the `Overview` page in the `My Apps`section.

    ![Pages and spaces view](15a-pages-spaces-view.png)

4. If you're working in groups mode, you'll see the `Purchase Orders` group that includes the Web Dynpro ABAP app called `Search POs`.

    ![View my apps](15-my-apps.png)

5. Click the app to launch it. This is what you'll see:
